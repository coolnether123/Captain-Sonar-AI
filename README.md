# Captain-Sonar-AI
 This is a c++ program using Visual Studio 2017 that simulates an AI playing one team of the board game Captain Sonar.
 
 This program was made for a final in my first c++ class. I went maybe a little overboard with creating it but i wanted to make an AI for captain sonar since only two people I knew would play it. I worked on this project for maybe 4 weeks and stayed up many nights solving problems.
 
 Currently there are only two difficulties Easy and Normal. Easy should be finished in some way I haven't finished a game with the AI yet. Normal is about 75% finished. Captain, engineer, and first mate are done on normal. The radio operator just needs its calculations finished.
 
 To tell the AI what map you are playing use * to represent open spaces and - for closed spaces.
 
 I used this format to allow for anyone to use whatever map they want and any maps they want to make. Do make sure that each tile is the same for the AI because if it isn't the AI will not be able to track your location.
 
 I'm super proud of this AI and as of 7/25/2020 I'd like to make it more efficient since it uses 5 threads overall. I have only used this program with computers that have 8 or more cores so I don't know how it affects computers with 4 cores.
